I'm a certified Full Stack Web Developer with more than a decade of professional experience managing web products in multiple work environments and using many tools, frameworks, libraries and CMSs. I can code in PHP, Javascript and Python following various software design patterns and also design functional, reactive and blazingly-fast UIs using different mechanisms for HTML rendering via client-side or server-side.

My responsibilities included the planning, executing and shipping high quality applications with the help of Agile teams, CI/CD and automated workflows for renowned organizations around the world like Toyota, UCLA Health, Banco Santander, Ncarb, The Bulletin of The Atomic Scientists and more.
